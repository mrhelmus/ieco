Functions include spatial, phylogenetic, and trait manipulation; as well as, simple statistical estimations. Many of functions utilize other packages and written as wrappers to perform the same operation across multiple data units and sets.

Some functions are based on datasets generated by the [The Integrative Ecology Lab at Temple University](https://www.iecolab.org "iEco Homepage"), and will need to be hacked to fit new data structures.
