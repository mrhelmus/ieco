# iEco R Package
*Functions for integrative ecology research*

Authored by [The Integrative Ecology Lab at Temple University](https://www.iecolab.org "iEco Homepage")

Functions include spatial, phylogenetic, and trait manipulation; as well as, simple statistical estimations. Some ieco functions wrap functions of other packages to perform the same operation across multiple data units and sets. Other functions are based on datasets generated by the [iEco Lab](https://www.iecolab.org "iEco Homepage"), and will need to be hacked to fit new data structures.
